# JS-Projects
I have made 2 webpages using basic JavaScript.

1. Tic Tac Toe Game
This is a small Rock-Paper-Scissors game where:
You click a choice (rock, paper, or scissor),
The computer randomly picks one too,
Then the game tells you if you won, lost, or it was a draw,
It also keeps track of your score and the computer's score.

3.  Rock Paper Scissor
This is a Tic-Tac-Toe game where:
Two players take turns clicking boxes.
Player 1 uses O, and Player 2 uses X.
The game checks if someone wins after every turn.
You can reset or start a new game.
